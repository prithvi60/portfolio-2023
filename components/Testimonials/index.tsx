It took a bit longer than what was initially desired but the quality of work overshadows this small issue.
      Communication with Prithvi was excellent throughout the project, and he was very responsive to any queries, concerns or bugs that we had. He demonstrated a great understanding of React in our project and was able to implement complex functionality.
      Overall, I'm extremely satisfied with the work that was done and would highly recommend to anyone looking for skilled and a reliable React/Front End developer. Thank you for your work. Continue what you're doing, peace!`,

Even though I asked him to work on a platform (bubble.io) he was not familiar with, he was able to pick it up very quickly and with little fuss. Kept to deadline well. Happy to fix bugs and make sure everything was done right. Fluent English speaker and good at communicating and very easy to talk with. All round 5-star experience. Will be coming back to him for sure.",
